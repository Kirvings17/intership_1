This project reads data from an input file and processes it to provide useful insights or perform certain operations. The primary function of this program is to allow users to interact with the data through a command-line interface, making it easy to retrieve specific information.

To run this program, follow the steps below:

Before running the program, ensure you have all the required dependencies set up. If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, make sure your project has the necessary library references (e.g., org.json for JSON handling).

1)Execute the Main Class:
Navigate to the location of your project in your terminal or open it in your preferred IDE.
Compile and run the Main class. This is the entry point for the application, and it contains the logic to process user input.
2)After running the program, you will be prompted to enter the file path of the file you wish to retrieve information from. Ensure that the file path is correct and accessible.
3)After that follow the instructions in the command line
